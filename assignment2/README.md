# Introduce of assignment 2

I implemented the part 3 in `INFO6205-Assignments/assignment2/src/main/java/edu/neu/coe/info6205/util/Benchmark_Timer.java`. 
- random array is generated by function `randomArr`;
- ordered array is generated by function `orderedArr`;
- partially ordered array is generated by function `partiallyOrderedArr`;
- reverse ordered array is generated by function `reverseOrderedArr`.

And I sorted the array with benchmark by function `sortArr`. Then run the main function to implement the part 3.
